**Healthy API** is a powerful and extensible tool for real-time health checking of your web services. Written in **Go**, this project helps you ensure the availability and proper functioning of your services through periodic checks. If any service fails, it instantly alerts you through multiple channels like Email, SMS, and custom Webhooks.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Service Monitoring:** Define and monitor an unlimited number of services simultaneously.
- **Multi-Channel Alerting System:** Get notified via **SMTP (Email)**, **SMS (IPPanel)**, and **Webhooks**. The architecture is extensible for adding new channels.
- **Intelligent Periodic Checks:** Set custom intervals (`check_period`) for monitoring each service.
- **Spam Prevention:** Define a cooldown period (`sleep_on_fail`) after a failure is detected to avoid repetitive alerts.
- **Customizable Health Conditions:** Specify the expected HTTP status code (`expected_status_code`) to define a "healthy" state for each service.
- **Concurrent by Design:** Utilizes Goroutines to monitor all services concurrently without blocking.
- **Easy Configuration:** All settings are managed through a single, human-readable `YAML` file.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+**
- Access to an SMTP server, an IPPanel SMS gateway, or a webhook endpoint.

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mosishon/healthy-api.git
    cd healthy-api
    ```

2.  **Create a configuration file** (e.g., `config.yaml`) by copying and modifying the `sample.yaml` file.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go -config=config.yaml
    ```

    Alternatively, you can build the executable first:
    ```bash
    go build -o healthy-api
    ./healthy-api -config=config.yaml -verbose
    ```
    > Use the `-verbose` flag to see detailed application logs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All settings are managed in a single YAML file. The structure is as follows:

```yaml
#===========================================
#        Services to Monitor
#===========================================
services:
  - name: "production-api-service" # A descriptive name for display in alerts
    url: "https://api.my-domain.com/health"
    
    expected_status_code: 200 # The expected HTTP status code for a successful check
    check_period: 60 # Check every 60 seconds
    sleep_on_fail: 300 # If the service fails, wait 5 minutes before the next check to prevent spam
    # On failure, send alerts to these targets
    targets:
      - notifier_id: "admins-email-group"
        recipients:
          - "admin1@example.com"
          - "cto@example.com"
      - notifier_id: "on-call-sms-alert"
        recipients:
          - "+989120000001"
      - notifier_id: "slack-notification-hook"
        recipients:
          # You can define multiple webhook URLs for a single notifier ID
          - "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
          - "https://your-custom-api-endpoint.com/notify"

#===========================================
#        Notification Channel Configuration
#===========================================
notifiers:
  # ------ Email Servers (SMTP) ------
  smtp:
    - id: "admins-email-group" # This ID must match the 'notifier_id' in services
      sender: "notifier@your-domain.com"
      password: "your-smtp-password"
      server: "smtp.your-domain.com"
      port: 587

  # ------ SMS Gateways (e.g., IPPanel) ------
  ippanel: 
    - id: "on-call-sms-alert"
      url: <YOUR_IPPANEL_URL>
      user: <YOUR_IPPANEL_USERNAME>
      pass: <YOUR_IPPANEL_PASSWORD>

  # ------ Webhooks (For sending custom POST requests) ------
  webhook:
    - id: "slack-notification-hook"
      # The HTTP method to use for the webhook (e.g., POST, PUT)
      method: POST
      # Custom headers for the request
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
        Authorization: "Bearer your-secret-token" # Example for an auth header
      # The JSON body of the request.
      # You can use template variables for dynamic values.
      json:
        # {{ .ServiceName }} is replaced with the service name
        message: "üî¥ Alert: Service '{{ .ServiceName }}' is down!"
        # {{ .TimeStamp }} is replaced with the failure timestamp
        timestamp: "{{ .TimeStamp }}"
        details: "Request to {{ .URL }} failed."
```
